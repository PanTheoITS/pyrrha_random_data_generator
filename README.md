# **Pyrrha: Random User Data Generator**

Pyrrha is a native desktop application that creates dynamic and realistic data to help developers test their software. It also provides other IT professionals such as system administrators with the opportunity to try out different scenarios for their companyâ€™s network infrastructure (databases, active directories, etc.) on a test server without using actual employee data.

Features: 

* It generates various types of user data (username, password, first and last name, email, etc.).
* You can enable or disable any field to produce only the kind of information you require. You can also change the field names.
* Addresses are created using a range of real districts in Athens (Greece). This way, you can use Pyrrha whenever you want to test apps that have geolocation capabilities.
* The program produces Greek names and addresses that are available in both Greek and Latin characters.
